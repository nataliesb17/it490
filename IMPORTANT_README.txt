URGENT: The WebHandler.cs script public variable "url" needs to be updated to a .php file thats on our website that can fetch information from the database that will pass the data along as a .json file. The naming conventions are strict because of Unity, so json data needs to follow the naming conventions shown in PokemonBase.cs. 

The public variable is not hard coded in and is left public so I can update it in Unity's inspector.
